# sql-challenge

Objective:
Create tables in SQL in order to run analysis on employee data for a company. Once the csv raw data is imported into tables on SQL, I can perform data engineering and data analysis to answer some questions about employees hired between the years 1980-1990.

Steps:

1. Use QuickDBD.com to create an Entity Relationship Diagram for our employee data. 
2. Create six tables on PGAdmin4 and import the csv files from the EmployeeSQL folder into those tables. 
3. Save the table schema created above to an sql file and upload to GitHub.
4. Using PGAdmin 4 and the Select function to create the following outputs:
       List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
       List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.
       List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.
       List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
       List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."
       List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
       List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
       In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.
5. Save the above queries into an sql file and upload to GitHub
