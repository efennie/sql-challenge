# sql-challenge

Objective:
Create tables in SQL in order to run analysis on employee data for a company. Once the csv raw data is imported into tables on SQL, I can perform data engineering and data analysis to answer some questions about employees hired between the years 1980-1990.

Steps:

1. Use QuickDBD.com to create an Entity Relationship Diagram for our employee data. 
2. Create six tables on PGAdmin4 and import the csv files from the EmployeeSQL folder into those tables.
